    During this research, I gained a lot of powerful knowledge in the field of Machine Learning. I learned how to use modern tools and libraries like Python3, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn. This research taught me how to apply Machine Learning to solve real-world problems. I managed to work with a really challenging data set representing corn Genotype. Our team, led by one of my university professors, has applied different approaches to data preparation to fit various mathematical models from K-Neighbors to XGBoost and many others.
