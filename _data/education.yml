    During my studies at the university, I acquired many technical skills in various fields of computer science. Also, I increased stress resistance, learned to work in a team, and adhere to strict deadlines. I am grateful to my university for special attention in teaching the techniques of proper code structuring, which makes it possible for large teams to work on the same project. My University not only introduced me to the world of high technologies but taught me how to use them ethically. It taught me what is professionalism and how is it to be a professional.
